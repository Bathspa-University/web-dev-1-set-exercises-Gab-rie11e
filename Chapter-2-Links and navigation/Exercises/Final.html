            <h3>• Final Fantasy VII •</h3>
            <p>The original Final Fantasy VII was first released in 1997. The game was directed by Yoshinori Kitase, Hironobu Sakaguchi as the executive producer and Shinji Hashimoto as the co-producer.
                The game was once being developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994, but as the project developed, it was moved to the Sony PlayStation because of the Nintendo's cartridge format's limitations.

                with turn-based combat system, exploration, power leveling, and individual unique skills that the characters can use.

            <h2>Plot:</h2>
                <p>The protagonist of Final Fantasy VII, Cloud Strife, was formerly a member of the elite military group known as SOLDIER. 
                In order to battle the dishonest megacorporation Shinra Electric Power Company, Cloud Strife joins the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE.
                <br>
                <br>
                AVALANCHE hired mercenary Cloud Strife to help the gang destroy a Mako Reactor, a facility that absorbs the planet's life force, known as Mako, for electricity,
                near the start of the game. Cloud meets other important people during the mission, such as childhood buddy Tifa Lockhart and AVALANCHE leader Barret Wallace. 
                As the narrative develops, it becomes clear that Shinra is using military force to maintain control while profiting from the planet's resources. 
                Shinra is also searching for a mysterious being called "Jenova" and hoping to use its strength for their own evil plans. Cloud's past comes back to haunt him 
                as he learns about Sephiroth, a legendary SOLDIER believed to be dead, who resurfaces with plans to summon Meteor and bring about the planet's destruction.
                Sephiroth's connection to Cloud and the truth behind his past form significant elements of the plot's development. 
                In an effort to stop Shinra and Sephiroth, Cloud sets out across the planet Gaia with his comrades. 
                They go through a variety of places, such as the peaceful hamlet of Nibelheim, the bustling metropolis of Midgar, and the immense wilderness of the planet's surface.
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout the story, Cloud struggles to distinguish between his own memories and those that Shinra implanted during his experiments, leading to identity issues. 
                His intentions are shaped and his character development is given depth by this internal conflict.
                The plot revolves around the idea of the Lifestream, which is the planet's life force. 
                It is revealed that Sephiroth intends to use the Lifestream's power to grow into an entity with godlike qualities. 
                This sets up Cloud and Sephiroth for a dramatic clash atop the Northern Crater.
                In order to stop Meteor from crashing into the Earth, Cloud and his allies face Sephiroth and his weapon, Jenova Synthesis, in the story's finale. 
                By means of perseverance, selflessness, and the strength of camaraderie, they manage to prevent the annihilation of Gaia.
                The battle's aftermath, when Cloud and his companions process what happened and how it changed their lives, forms the story's climax. 
                The story ends with hope for the future as they work to restore and cure the earth.</p>
